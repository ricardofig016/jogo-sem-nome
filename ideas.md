# Ideas

## World

an eternal labyrinth of ancient ruins, home to spirits and demons

- why are there ruins?
- what is the structure of the ruins?
- what are spirits and demons?

most paths in the ruins are covered in the shadows from other ruins, providing for an eerie, cavy crossing

sometimes, the ruins move change place, what makes it impossible to map the labyrinth or settle in the same place.

- why do they move?
- when do they move?

the spirits are starved, as there are no longer any societies to worship them.

the few people there are still around are called wanderers, or children of stone, or the awakened ones

the wanderers are born from the many sleeping statues of stone found everywhere in the ruins

water can be found averywhere from the many fountains

roots, moss, mushrooms and fruits can be foraged for food

the ruins themselves provide clothing and tools, which are scavanged and used by the wanderers

- who left these supplies here? (ancient civilizations, the ones who built the ruins)

there are places of sanctuary, where entities known as the "great spirits" have shrines that are safe from demons

- what are the great spirits? (the older, most powerful, most important spirits)
- are they good or evil? (mostly good)
